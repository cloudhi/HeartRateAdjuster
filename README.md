#Heart Rate Adjuster
####Kenny Bambridge, Jonathan Chang, Samani Gikandi, Tae-Min Kim, Nikhil Shenoy, Revan Sopher

This is our semester-long project for Software Engineering class. It's an Android application that monitors a user's heart rate using a Bluetooth chest strap, and attempts to adjust it to a target level by playing faster or slower music.

The focus of the course was more on documentation than implementation, so the highlight is the 124 page report (`doc/report.pdf`). The code is in `android/`, and there's frozen snapshots of both the report and code sitting there (checkpoint deliverables).

TODO:

-	The Bluetooth code is entirely non functional.
-	The Android app and music selection server need to be joined.
