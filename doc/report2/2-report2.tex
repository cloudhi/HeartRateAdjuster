\section{Product Ownership}
Our team will be divided into three smaller sub-teams of two individuals. Each sub-team will be responsible for developing a specific sub-product during the bulk of their time. Upon completion of a significant portion of work, they will provide a brief description of their activity before they push it to our Github repository. In addition to documentation, they will also include the necessary UML diagrams, charts, algorithms, and source code. Every week, or at least once before each deliverable, we will meet together for 1-3 hours during a timeframe determined by a combination of GroupMe and When2meet. During the meeting, we will have a specific agenda that primarily involves the week's progress and upcoming deliverable. Our discussion will probably be centered along the following questions: 1) What did you work on this past week? 2) What do you plan on working on next week? 3) Are there any revisions that need to be made to the project? Every week, a team member will take the lead for the next deliverable to ensure that everything is on time.
corollary
\begin{itemize}
    \item Revan and Tae-Min will work on the general user interface of the mobile application. They will design the layout and basic functionality of the Android app, and set up the communication protocol between the heart rate monitor and the phone. 
    \item Kenny and Samani will work on the music aspect of the mobile application. They will study music playback features such as track selection and queuing to provide customers with a seamless music player experience. They will also be responsible for the nuances of audio playback such as crossfading transitions and tempo adjustments.
    \item Jon and Nikhil will work on the data logging faculties that are necessary to provide the user with feedback about his/her workout. They will work with a server that captures heart rate and music data from the phone and possibly directly from the heart rate monitor. They will determine how to process this information on the server and create customizable graphical displays for user's to view.
