The Audio Black Box refers to two things. 'AudioBlackbox' is a Java interface that lives on the smartphone. This interface is used by other subsystems of the heartBPM application to control audio playback and get information about the music that's currently playing. In general terms, the Audio Black Box is the entire audio subsystem. It handles the queueing of songs, interfacing with native Android subsystems for playing actual audio streams, and with a server backend.
