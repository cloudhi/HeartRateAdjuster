The Audio BlackBox Subsystem uses a Client-Server architecture internally. The server stores and coordinates all audio files/streams as well as the playlist determination logic. The client, in this case a mobile device, abstracts the server's behavior into an interface for retrieving metadata and altering playback. Additionally, the client interfaces with the mobile device's faculties for outputting audio.
