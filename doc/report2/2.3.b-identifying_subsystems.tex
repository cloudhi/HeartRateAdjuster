    Our software is designed around three primary subsystems. The core subsystem is the UI Subsystem. This subsystem is responsible for interfacing with the user, the chest strap, and provisioning other hardware and software faculties. The Audio BlackBox subsystem handles all audio playback faculties. The Data Logging Subsystem is used for recording data about workouts. Additionally, this subsystem provides faculties for displaying and manipulating logged data. Within each of these subsystems are further subsystems.
