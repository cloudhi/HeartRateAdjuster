To test the graphing feature, import the folder called "jfreeSample" in the same way described above. Click the run button. To see whether the application ran correctly, look for the statement "printed the picture" in the LogCat menu. If this statement appears, then check the jfreeSample directory for a .png file named testGraph.png. This is the output of the test, and should be a randomized graph of heart rates. The script in this case is the plain LinePlot.java file, and its purpose to make sure that a graph can be printed and saved using the data retrieved from the records.
